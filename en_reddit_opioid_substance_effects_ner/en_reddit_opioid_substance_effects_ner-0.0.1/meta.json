  "description":"This is a Named Entity Recognition model intended to predict SUBSTANCES and EFFECTS related to opioid use and withdrawal. The model was trained on several thousand reddit comments from the r/opioids and r/OpiatesRecovery subreddits. There are two labeled entities, SUBSTANCE and EFFECT. EFFECT: a theraputic or adverse effect mentioned as a result or rationale for consuming a substance. SUBSTANCE: a drug, remedy, supplement, or other consumable item used to treat an effect or induce a desired effect.",
